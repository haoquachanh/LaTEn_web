- Examination types: grammar, vocabulary, listening, reading, mixed
- Difficulty levels: beginner, intermediate, advanced
- Real-time result calculation and detailed feedback

## ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

2. Create `.env` file based on `.env.example`

3. Setup PostgreSQL database

4. Run migrations (if any)

5. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

## ðŸ“š API Documentation
- Available at: `http://localhost:3001/api/docs`
- Swagger UI with all endpoints documented
- Bearer token authentication for protected routes

## ðŸ”„ Integration with Frontend
- Backend runs on port 3001
- CORS configured for frontend (port 3000)
- API prefix: `/api`
- JWT tokens for authentication
- Consistent error response format

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
1. Test authentication flow with frontend
2. Implement examination taking UI
3. Build comment/discussion features
4. Add file upload for images/audio in questions
5. Implement real-time features (Socket.io)
6. Add email notifications
7. Implement user progress tracking
